## Card Storage

The UltimateDrive uses Micro SD cards for storage of your disk images.  It is designed for UHS-1 or better SDHC/SDXC cards.

More performant cards should result in higher transfer speeds.

Format your card with a FAT filesystem like FAT32 or exFAT.

## Card Installation

After formatting your Micro SD card and inserting it in the UltimateDrive.  Install the UltimateDrive in your Apple II system with the Micro SD card slot side pointed toward the front/keyboard of your system.
