## Networking

UltimateDrive supports Ethernet networking, allowing you to turn your Apple II into an Internet powerhouse.  ðŸ˜‰

### Prerequisites

To use the Internet with your UltimateDrive card you need a few things:

- UltimateDrive Network Adapter (it uses the ubiquitous W5500 networking module)
- Some software to connect to the Internet.  This wasn't available when these machines were created, but there are many options now
  - [IP65](https://github.com/cc65/ip65) 
  - [Marinetti LinkLayer](https://github.com/Ultimate-Drive/udnet/tree/main/src) (IIgs)
