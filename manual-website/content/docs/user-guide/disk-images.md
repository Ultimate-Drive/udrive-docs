## Disk Images

Devices like the UltimateDrive, as well as emulators, all use the idea of a file on the host which represents some kind of storage medium.  For Apple II disks, there are many image formats you can use with UltimateDrive.

There are a variety of image types representing different formats, and often more than one physical medium.  We won't cover them all here, but for example, `.PO` represents a ProDOS Order disk format, but that could be a 5.25" floppy or 3.25" floppy, or even a 32MB hard disk image!  

### Disk II images supported:

`S2E`, `NIB`, `DSK`, `PO`


### Hard disk images supported:
`PO`, `HDV`, `IMG`, `2MG`, `S2E`
